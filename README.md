# Mingyuan-Han
This is my code and all data set needed for my extended essay. I used the code from others and made some edits to it.

The main changes I did is in network.py. For the SDG funciton, which trains the ANN and runs the ANN on the test data set, I add a new parameter in it, which is the number of the coloum that the result of the ANN should be saved in the excel file. In the funciton, It will make a new sheet in the excel file and save the result of each testing in it.

To achieve this function, I used teh module named xlwt to help me make changes on excel file.

The reason of this is that it can help me prevent meaningless work and work more efficiently.

I labeled #mingyuan before where I added my own codes.
